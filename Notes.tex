A first-order dependence logic $\D$ is a class which consists of all $\D$-definable properties where $\D := (\FO + \mu.\bar{t})$ and $\mu.\bar{t}$ denotes that term $t_{|\bar{t}|}$ is functionally dependent on $t_{i}$ for all $i\leq |\bar{t}|$. Recall that a $P$-definable property is a closed under isomorphism class $P$ of structures. The model class of a first-order sentence $\varphi$ is the class of structures $\Mod(\varphi):=\{A:A\models\varphi\}$ where the notation $A\models\varphi$ refers to the \emph{`the snow is white' iff the snow is white} type of Tarskian semantics, of $\varphi$ being true when interpreted in $A$ under all $\alpha$ assignment function ($\forall\alpha\in A\models\varphi[\alpha]$). 

The model class $\FO$ is, as always, defined as the class of models of all first-order sentences (i.e. $\FO:= \{S:(\exists\tau)(\exists\varphi\in L(\tau))\ S=\Mod(\varphi)\}$ where $L(\tau)$ is a first-order language of type $\tau$) and $\mu.\bar{t}$ is interpreted as a recursively generated tuple of terms which we naturally identify with the set $[|\bar{t}|] := \{1,2,\dots,|\bar{t}|\}$. $\D$ sentences are capable to characterise variable dependence and in general they are proven to be as expressive as the sentences of the second order $\Sigma_1^1$ fragment \cite{dep}. The intuitionistic dependence version $\ID$ has the same expressive power as full $\SO$ \cite{dep}. It is a fact that $\MID$-model checking is $\PSPACE$-complete \cite{dep} where $\MID$ is the intuitionistic implication fragment of the modal dependence logic $\MD$ which contains at least two modifiers. Hence, $(\FO + \mu.\bar{t}) = \NP, \ID = \Sigma_{\ast}\P$ and $\MID = \PSPACE$.  On the other hand, $\PSPACE = \IP = \QIP$ \cite{qip}, and so $\MID = \QIP$ which is the quantum version of the interactive polytime class $\IP$.

We shall try to cook up a purely algebraic definition for the class of structures $\MID$ and extend such categorical logic in order to capture other quantum and classical complexity classes. 

Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games characterise the expressive power of logical languages \cite{ams}. Every Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game is an ultraproduct \cite{models}. A back-and-forth method for showing isomorphism between countably infinite structures. If $F$ is an ultrafilter (i.e. $F\subseteq 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ and $\forall X\subseteq\mathbb{N} (X\notin F \Leftrightarrow \mathbb{N}\setminus X\in F)$ holds) then the reduced product $\prod_{i}M_i / F$ is an ultraproduct of the sets $M_i$, $i\in I$. Recall that \[f\sim g \Leftrightarrow \{i\in I : f(i) = g(i)\}\in F\] for all infinite sequences $f,g\in\prod_i M_i$ and any index set $I$ is the relation which induces the equivalence classes that conform the ultraproduct \[\prod_{i}M_i / F = \{[f]:f\in\prod_i M_i\}.\] 

\begin{lem}[$\defaultL$o\'s Lemma]
If $F$ is an ultrafilter and $\varphi$ a first-order formula, then the ultraproduct of models of $\varphi$ indexed by any index set $I\in F$ is a model of $\varphi$, i.e. \[(\prod_i A_i / F , \alpha)\models\varphi\Leftrightarrow\{i\in I: (A_i, \alpha_i)\models\varphi\}\in F.\]
