A first-order dependence logic $D$ is a class which consists of all $D$-definable properties where $D := (FO + \mu.\bar{t})$ and $\mu.\bar{t}$ denotes that term $t_{|\bar{t}|}$ is functionally dependent on $t_{i}$ for all $i\leq |\bar{t}|$. The model class $FO$ is as always defined as the class of models of all first-order sentences (i.e. $FO:= \{S:(\exists\tau)(\exists\varphi\in L(\tau))\ S=Mod(\varphi)\}$ where $L(\tau)$ is a first-order language of type $\tau$) and $\mu.\bar{t}$ is interpreted as a recursively generated tuple of terms which we naturally identify with the set $[|\bar{t}|] := \{1,2,\dots,|\bar{t}|\}$. $D$ sentences are capable to characterise variable dependence and in general they are proven to be as expressive as the sentences of the second order $\Sigma_1^1$ fragment. The intuitionistic dependence version $ID$ has the same expressive power as full $SO$. It is a fact that $MID$-model checking is $PSPACE$-complete where $MID$ is the intuitionistic implication fragment of the modal dependence logic $MD$ which contains at least two modifiers. Hence, $(FO + \mu.\bar{t}) = NP, ID = \Sigma_{\ast}P$ and $MID = PSPACE$.  On the other hand, $PSPACE = IP = QIP$ and so $MID = QIP$ the quantum version of the interactive polytime class.

We shall try to cook up a purely algebraic definition for the class of structures $MID$ and extend such categorical logic in order to capture other quantum and classical complexity classes.
